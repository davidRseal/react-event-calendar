# REACT-EVENT-CALENDAR Storybook app

# (live demo: https://davidrseal.github.io/react-event-calendar)

This project was generated using the Storybook guide here <https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started/>

My contribution is the Calendar componenent at `src/stories/Calendar.jsx` which is an interactive calendar component for scheduling and viewing "events." It's meant to be integrated into React apps.

Code examples are at `src/stories/Calendar.stories.jsx` and there's an interactive demo within Storybook if you run the app.
The Storybook is statically hosted at https://davidrseal.github.io/react-event-calendar through GitHub Pages.

A quick look at the top-level files and directories included with this template.
